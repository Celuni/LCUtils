# LCUtils ![lcu logo](https://i.imgur.com/mQK0ebu.png) LCUTils is a League of Legends CLIENT utility program(does NOT interact with the game at all).  # FEATURES:  * Auto Accept queues for when you need to quickly go AFK.  * Send desktop notifications for when you receive notifications(without having to open the client).  * Extensible plugin architecture, so developers can create their own client extensions easily.  As of now, there is no working UI. But running the program will still work properly if you run it(provided you are on Windows 8+, which will change soon). Speaking of running the program...  # USAGE:  * Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/patthekenny/LCUtils.git`  * CD into the folder you cloned the repo into: `cd LCUtils`  * Install all dependencies from NPM: `npm install`  * Install electron from NPM: `npm i -g electron`  * Run the program: `npm start`  # TODO:  * Auto-Crafter to disenchant champion shards.  * Random profile icon selection.  * Restart UX when you've crashed.  * Relog/Log into different accounts with the click of a button.  # LICENSE ``` Copyright (C) didey 2016  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
